This folder is here specifically for USG staff to be able to set up the Nerf Turret in its current configuration. 

USGQuickStart.md: how to wire up and start up the one, actual USG Nerf Drone that's on campus that we built.

ModifyingCVPipeline.md: how to change which computer vision algorithm is doing the detecting and tracking targets.

CVInterface.md: the API used to connect pre-existing or homemade detection and tracking algorithms to the main part of the program.

ProtoSpec.md: a basic specification of the protocol built on top of TCP/IP and UDP that the Nerf Turret software uses.
