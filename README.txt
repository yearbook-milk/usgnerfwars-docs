If you look at the old README in commit history, that was all lies. I don't have time to extensively document this project (exams and other stuff like that), and all USG wants is to be able to start up and configure our project, so I've just placed some quick tutorials in quick_start. Perhaps one day the actual inner workings and interfaces of the project will be documented, but not today.
