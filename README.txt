* How to set up this software on an embedded system such as the Raspberry Pi
* What all the settings do
* The logic behind the computer vision and networking systems
* The networking protocol specification (for people looking to create alternate remote control clients and whatnot)
* The API used to add different tracking and detection algorithms
